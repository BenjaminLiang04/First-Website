<h1>Benjamin Liang</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Benjamin Liang, I am a grade 10 student here at Lord Byng secondary school. My favourite subject in school
is science. One hobby I enjoy doing is playing the piano.</p>

<p>My favourite food is rice, and my favourite colour is purple. My family consists of myself, my mom and my dad, my sister,
 my brother, and my cat and dog. I am currently in Lord Byng's junior symphony and I play as the pianist.</p>
